# LINUX-Card
LINUX-Card is just like the game Bingo Card. The player inputs a character and this calls a Bingo number. If the Bingo number matches a number from the LINUX-Card the card is marked. The first player to mark an entire row or column or the four sides of the card wins the game. I have received part help with the code from Harshita Singh.
